# Hill Climb Gesture Control 
This project implements a gesture-controlled version of the popular game Hill Climb Racing using OpenCV and Python. The game allows players to control the car's acceleration and braking using hand gestures captured through a webcam. Hand tracking and gesture recognition are performed using the OpenCV library, while PyAutoGUI is used to map the gestures to the game controls.
